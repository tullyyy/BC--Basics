            <em>
              HTML is the structure and backbone of the website, whereas CSS is
              how the website is presented.</em

              also makes the web more accesible IE: If someone is using a

      <h2>More Questions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Why should you care about how your code is formatted?</li>
        <p>
          Because if we use the general and standard practices, our code will
          not only be easier for us to write coherently and uniformly but it
          will be the same with others across the board when we are commiting to
          a larger project and someone is reading it.
        </p>
        <li>How many spaces should you indent at a time?</li>
        <p>2</p>
        <li>
          Should the code be lowercase or uppercase? What is the recommended
          encoding?
        </li>
        <p>The recommended code is lowercase with the exception of strings.</p>
        <li>
          How should you use comment to explain your code? How do you do it in
          HTML and in CSS?
        </li>
        <p>
          You use comments to write a "secret" note that will not be viewed or
          seen except within the code. I use a shortcut to enable block comment
          <code>&lt;!-- comment here--&gt;</code>
          but there is also the line comment <code>//</code>
        </p>
        <li>How do you validate your HTML?</li>

        <p>
          You can use a validator like: W3C HTML validator to test you page.
        </p>
        <li>What is the purpose of the alt attribute?</li>
        <p>
          It is important for accesibility. If a blind person uses their reader
          to access your site, you can provide an alt to give them a description
          of the image. It will also load in case your photo does not.
        </p>
        <li>
          Should you separate structure (markup), presentation (styling), and
          behavior (scripting)? If yes, why?
        </li>
        <p>Yes. It is easier to maintain seperate sheets of code.</p>
        <li>
          Should you use double or single quotation marks around attribute
          values?
        </li>
        <p>Double.</p>
        <li>How can you validate your CSS code?</li>
        <p>You can use a validator like: W3C CSS validator to test you page.</p>
        <li>
          When would you use meaningful ID/class names? When would you use
          generic ones?
        </li>

        <p>
          They should reflect the purpose of why you are using them (least
          likely to change and most likely to be understood). Generic names "the
          probability of unnecessary document or template changes."
